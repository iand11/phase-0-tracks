# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
-version control is a way to record changes to a file/document so you can come back to specific changes. It is useful because you can make changes and document them without having to change the master file/document.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?
-A branch is a copy of the master repository that makes it possible to make changes without changing the master. You would use a branch when multiple people are working on the same project and working on different parts. In the end the branches can come back and be integrated into the master. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
-A commit is a save point once signifigant changes have been made. A good commit message is one that is detailed but also to the point.

* What is a merge conflict?
-A merge conflict is when more than one person is working and deletes or changes a line or part that is critical to the other. This results in git not knowing what to do with the merge and stoping any progress.
